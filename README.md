# Cryptobot

A bot that trades crypto-currencies for you.

## Strategy

The crypto market is very volatile, and therefore the fluctuations in the prices of the crypto-currencies can be used to create profit by buying currencies in bear markets and selling in bull markets.

It would be nearly impossible to create a bot that can predict the future changes of the price of a certain coin due to the numerous factors that take part in determining its price.

For a simple strategy, I am looking for a coin that has a fairly stable average but with fluctuations that exceed the 0.5% everyday. I am currently thinking of using TRIBE or USDC.
